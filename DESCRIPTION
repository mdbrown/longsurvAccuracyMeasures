Package: longsurvAccuracyMeasures
Type: Package
Title: Evaluate a partly conditional model fit using the R package `partlyconditional`. Given validation data consisting of a time-to-event outcome and longitudinal marker information on a set of individuals up to a fixed time window, this package includes functions to assess model calibration and evaluate prognostic accuracy for a future landmark prediction time. Point estimates, along with bootstrap confidence intervals,  are provided for the following accuracy measures: AUC, ROC (TPF/FPF), PPV, NPV, PCF (proportion cases followed), and PNF (proportion needed to follow).
